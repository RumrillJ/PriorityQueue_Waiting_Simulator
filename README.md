# PriorityQueue_Waiting_Simulator

Bank Line Java Simulator that Simulates a Bank Line using PriorityQueue

This Program on execution will have a people randomly generated walking into the bank (added to the line as a normal day) and will update in real time...
The wait time and how many people in line are before the customer to be helped. This simulator will end on its own once the bank day is over and will print out
the average wait time and total time (cumulatively), so banks or another service system may know if they'd need to hire more staff and/or improve efficiency and other
data to improve a business.
